0 $You find yourself in a dimly lit cavern. You are not 
sure how you got here but you know you have to find a way 
out. Checking yourself you find you have an electric 
flashlight and a compass with which to navigate. 
$You look around. Goto 1

1 $This is a relatively plain, featureless cavern with 
rugged walls and fairly flat, gravel-like floor. Looking 
around the cavern you see there are three tunnels exiting 
this cavern.
$Do you go north? Goto 2
$Do you go east? Goto 3
$Do you go south? Goto 4

2 $This cavern has a pool of water in it. At a distance you 
cannot see clearly into the pool. Also this cavern has two 
exits, one heading south, one heading east. 
$Do you investigate the pool? Goto 2a
$Do you go south? Goto 1
$Do you go east? Goto 5
---
2a $You go over to the pool and lean over. As you peer in, 
a huge albino octopus rushes up from the depths and lashes 
out of the water with suckered tentacles. You try to 
retreat from the pool before the creature can pull you down
You lose 5 stamina. //-5
$Do you go south? Goto 1
$Do you go east? Goto 5
---
3 $This cavern has something strange in the middle. It 
looks like a pedestal with a golden skull. The Golden Skull 
is about human-sized but looks distorted and slightly 
alien. Looking around the edges of the cavern there are two 
exits, one tunnel heading west, one tunnel heading east. 
$Do you investigate the gold skull? Goto 3a
$Do you go west? Goto 1
$Do you go east? Goto 6

3a $You go to the pedestal and you reach out to pick up 
the skull. ZZAAPP!! You are shocked as electric current 
shoots from the skull to your hands. You are thrown away 
from the skull. 
You lose 5 stamina //-5 
$Do you go west? Goto 1
$Do you go east? Goto 6

4 $This cavern is empty except for a wrapped up parcel on 
the floor. There is only a single exit heading north. 
$Do you go north? Goto 1
$Do you investigate the parcel? Goto 4a

4a $The parcel contains a cheese and chutney sandwich which 
you devour. 
You gain 3 stamina //3
$You leave the cavern and head back north. Goto 1

5 $This cavern contains the fossilized bones of some 
ancient giant beast, perhaps a dinosaur. There are two 
exits, one to the west and one to the east. 
$Do you investigate the bones? Goto 5a
$Do you go west? Goto 2
$Do you go east? Goto 7
---
5a $The huge fossilised bones are home to a vicious 
scorpion the size of an alligator. It rushes out, lashing 
with its pincers, wounding you before you jump away. 
You lose 4 stamina and the scorpion scuttles back into the 
pile of fossils. // -4
$Do you go west? Goto 2
$Do you go east? Goto 7
---
6 $This cavern has a massive crack in the floor dropping 
down to a chasm running across the cavern from north to 
south. There is a ricketty-looking bridge made up of fence 
posts and old rope. You are currently on the west side 
where there is a tunnel heading west. There is another 
tunnel on the far side heading east. 
$Do you go west? Goto 3
$Do you cross the rope bridge? Goto 6a
---
6a $The rope bridge seems to hold and you gingerly start to 
cross it. As you do so, a massive flapping shape flies out 
of the chasm below you. It is a giant bat, and it swoops 
down with its claws, lashing you for 2 stamina before 
flying back down into the darkness. //-2
$You cross the ropebridge. Goto 6b
---
6b $You are now on the east side of a cavern with a chasm 
running from north to south. There is a rather flimsy-
looking bridge across the yawning gap, made of rope and 
wooden planks. There is an exit on your side heading east, 
and another exit on the other side of the chasm heading 
west. 
$Do you cross the bridge and head west? Goto 6c
$Do you take the exit east? Goto 9
---
6c $As you carefully cross the rickety bridge, a huge bat 
flaps out of the chasm and bites you for 2 stamina then 
flies back down into the darkness. //-2
$You hurry across the bridge. Goto 6
---
7 $This cavern is filled with various fungi. There are tall 
green ones, broad-capped blue mushrooms and small white 
ones. The cavern has three exit tunnels, one to the west, 
one to the north and one to the east.
$Do you go west? Goto 5
$Do you go north? Goto 13
$Do you go east? Goto 8
$Do you try to eat the green fungi? Goto 7a
$Do you try to eat the blue fungi? Goto 7b
$Do you try to eat the white fungi? Goto 7c
---
7a $You pull off a chunk of tall, green fungus cap and 
tenatively put it in your mouth. It actually tastes quite 
nice, like peaches mixed with walnuts. As you eat enough 
green fungal cap to fill your stomach you gain 2 stamina. 
However, you have temporarily depleted the green fungi - 
you've eaten all the edible bits. //2
$Do you go west? Goto 5
$Do you go north? Goto 13
$Do you go east? Goto 8
$Do you try to eat the blue fungi? Goto 7b
$Do you try to eat the white fungi? Goto 7c
---
7b $You pull off a piece of blue fungus and chew on it. It 
tastes rather bland but within minutes you start to have 
stomach cramps and retching. You bring the blue fungus back 
up onto the cavern floor and lose 4 stamina. //-4
$Do you go west? Goto 6
$Do you go north? Goto 13
$Do you go east? Goto 8
$Do you try to eat the green fungi? Goto 7a
$Do you try to eat the white fungi? Goto 7c
---
7c $You try some of the small white fungi. The fungus 
itself tastes like raw corgette. Within minutes the room 
begins to glow eerily, the walls and fungi start to change 
colour and strange geometric shapes in reds, blues and 
purples emerge from the floor. You rush off in a blind 
panic as you lose control of your mind. Your consciousness 
temporarily slips away as insanity takes your body for a 
joy ride. When you regain clarity, it seems you have ended 
up back where you started. At least you are alive. 
$You look around. Goto 1
---
8 $This chamber is filled with stalactites, stalagmites 
and limestone columns.  There are three exits, one to the 
west, one to the south and one to the east. As you stand 
looking around the cavern you hear a scuttling noise gently 
echoing around the chamber.
$Do you investigate the noise? Goto 8a
$Do you go west? Goto 7
$Do you go south? Goto 9
$Do you go east? Goto 12
---
8a $You head towards the scuttling noise and see a giant 
gecko perched head down on a column. It is a huge creature 
the size of a crocodile and it looks at you briefly, before 
deciding you are edible. It tries to bite your head off but 
you raise your arm just in time. As you try to scramble 
away and make a dash for one of the exits, its teeth sink 
into your arm and you lose 4 stamina..//-4 
$Do you go west? Goto 7
$Do you go south? Goto 9
$Do you go east? Goto 12   
---
9 $This cavern has somebody wandering around it, possibly 
searching or maybe patrolling. They are swinging what seems 
to be a baseball bat in their hand, and they are wearing a 
security guard's jumpsuit. Their brutish face does not seem
friendly. However, there are also many boulders around this 
cavern, and it may be possible to access one of the three 
exits by stealth. The three tunnels from this cavern lead 
north, west and east. 
$Do you try to talk to the guard? Goto 9a
$Do you try to attack the guard in a rush? Goto 9b
$Do you try to sneak around, hiding behind the boulders? Goto 9c
---
9a $The guard notices you approach, and moves towards you, 
baseball bat in hand. You greet him and try to ask him how
to find the exit. He snarls and swings the bat at you. You 
catch the blow on your arm and then another blow in your 
ribs. You decide that he is not conversational, and make a 
dash for one of the exits as he swings his club at you 
again. You loose 4 stamina. //-4
$Do you head west? Goto 6b
$Do you head north? Goto 8
$Do you head east? Goto 10
---
9b $You rush at the unsuspecting security guard. He doesn't 
see you until too late. He brings his baseball bat down 
glancing on your head, as you knock him to the ground. He 
is out cold for the moment though your head hurts (-2 
stamina). //-2
$Do you head east? Goto 6b
$Do you head north? Goto 8
$Do you head east? Goto 10
---
9c $Staying as quiet as possible you crawl around behind 
the boulders near the walls of the cavern while the 
security guard simply wanders around the center of the 
cavern, seemingly unaware of you. You have a choice of 
three exits.  
$Do you head east? Goto 6b
$Do you head north? Goto 8
$Do you head east? Goto 10
---
10 $This cave is well-lit with electric lamps, and there is 
a middle-aged man in a lab coat with spectacles and hardly 
any hair. There are biological specimens in glass jars over 
2m tall - huge lizards, giant spiders, giant snakes and 
scorpions, all dead and floating in preservatives.
There are three exits, north, south and west. 
$Do you attack the man? Goto 10a
$Do you talk to the man? Goto 10b
$Do you ignore him and simply head for one of the exits? Goto 10c
---
10a $You rush towards the man who shrieks in fear, but he 
pulls out a surgical scalpel and starts slashing with it. 
You eventually knock him out but only after he inflicts 
several stab wounds on you (-3 stamina). //-3
$Do you head west? Goto 9
$Do you head north? Goto 11
$Do you head south? Goto 12
---
10b $The middle-aged man smiles as he sees you approach. 
"Ah, the prodigal fool returns! I was wondering what would 
happen to you when we dumped you in the back of the cave 
system. Personally I expected you to get eaten by my pets," 
he says, waving at the preserved monstrous specimens. "But 
I am being rude! You are tired, hungry and injured. I just 
happen to have a little pick-me-up in my pocket." He 
reaches into his lab coat and pulls out a hypodermic 
syringe, and pulls the plastic guard off the needle as he 
advances towards you. 
$Do you accept the injection? Goto 10d
$Do you feign acceptance then attack him? Goto 10e
$Do you run away to one of the exits? Goto 10c
---
10c $As you make a dash across the chamber the man in the
lab coat picks a scalpel out of his pocket and flings it at 
you like a throwing knife. It sticks in your shoulder (-1 
stamina). // -1
$Do you go north? Goto 11
$Do you go west? Goto 9
$Do you go south? Goto 12
---
10d $You allow the man to stick the needle in your arm and 
you feel the cold fluid seeping into your veins. As you 
loose consciousness, your last ever thought is maybe this 
was not a good idea... Within an hour your lifeless body is 
his latest specimen on display. //-100
---
10e $You allow him to get close then suddenly make your 
move, punching him in the face and knocking him to the 
ground. He yells in pain and fear as he tries to get back 
up. You make a run for one of the exits. 
$Do you head west? Goto 9
$Do you head north? Goto 11
$Do you head south? Goto 12
---
11 $This chamber only has one exit to the south, which you 
have just come in by. The room is lit by electric lamps, 
and there is both an operating table, a set of shelves with 
various surgical implements and a mature woman in an gown 
strapped down onto a metal bed. She sees you across the 
room and starts trying to yell, though the strap across her 
mouth stops her from making much noise. 
$Do you investigate the shelves of instruments? Goto 11a
$Do you ungag the woman but leave her strapped down? Goto 11b
$Do you completely release the woman? Goto 11c
---
11a $There are scalpels, forceps, syringes and brown 
bottles of liquids with illegible labels. You decide to 
leave these items alone. There are also boxes of gauze and 
bandaging. 
$You look around. Goto 11
---
11b $You ungag the woman on the metal bed. She says "Thank 
God you're here! Let me go! I can help you if you want." 
You ask her who she is. "My name is Christin, I was the 
laboratory assistant to Dr Ungol, who works in the previous 
chamber. He went mad and decided I was stealing his ideas, 
and he's going to do horrible things to me. You've got to 
release me!"
$Do you release her? Goto 11c
$Do you leave her tied up? Goto 11
$Do you investigate the shelves of instruments? Goto 11a
---
11c $The woman is clearly grateful for being set free and 
explains that her boss, a scientist nearby, has gone mad. 
She offers first aid to heal your wounds, gesturing to the 
shelves of medical equipment. 
$Do you accept her offer of help? Goto 11d
$Do you leave the area and exit south? Goto 10
---
11d $Despite any concerns you might have the lab assistant 
leaves the strange phials and needles alone and efficiently 
dresses your wounds with the supplies on the shelves. You 
gain 4 stamina. //4
$You thank her and leave via the south exit. Goto 10
---
12 $This chamber has three exits, heading north, south and 
west. It is only dimly lit but you can make out the shapes 
of two large animals, maybe dogs, lying in the middle of 
the floor. They appear asleep but you cannot tell from this 
distance. 
$Do you want to run across quickly? Goto 12a
$Do you want to sneak across quietly? Goto 12b
$Do you want to be friendly and approach the dogs? Goto 12c
---
12a $Your feet scrabbling along the loose stoney floor 
cause quite a noise and the guard dogs awaken and give 
chase. They are rotweillers, big, powerful and faster than 
you. They bite your legs and hands and inflict severe 
injuries as you struggle towards one of the exits (-4 
stamina). //-4
$Do you head north? Goto 10
$Do you head west? Goto 14
$Do you head south? Goto 15
---
12b $You tiptoe quietly and the large dogs stay asleep. 
Staying as stealthy as possible you head to one of the 
exits. 
$Do you head north? Goto 10
$Do you head west? Goto 14
$Do you head south? Goto 15
---
12c $The dogs spring to the alert and see you approach. 
They growl but don't attack - they seem unsure what to do. 
After making reassuring noises, the two rotweillers settle 
back down, not asleep but keeping an eye on you. You decide 
to leave before the guard dogs change their minds. 
$Do you head north? Goto 10
$Do you head west? Goto 14
$Do you head south? Goto 15
---
13 $This cavern contains numerous piles of boulders and 
rubble, as if there have been cave-ins. There seems to be a 
pair of booted legs sticking out from under a pile of 
rocks. The only exit is to the south, where you came from. 
$Do you go south? Goto 7
$Do you investigate the body under the rubble? Goto 13a
---
13a $The poor sod who was crushed under the rocks here is 
quite dead. However, his lunchbox has survived and inside 
is a large cheese and salami sandwich. You promptly eat it 
and gain 2 stamina. //2 
$There is one way out, back south. Goto 7
---
14 $This chamber is dominated by a cage that contains a 
huge gorilla, perhaps 4m tall and weighing several tonnes. 
It looks at you quizzically and leans forward, pressing its 
face against the bars to sniff you. To one side there is a 
control panel that you guess opens or locks the cage. There 
are three exits from this chamber, east, west and south. 
$Do you try to unlock the cage and release the gorilla? Goto 14a
$Do you head west? Goto 12
$Do you head east? Goto 17
$Do you head south? Goto 16
---
14a $You find the unlock switch on the control panel and 
there is a clunk as the door to the cage swings ajar. The 
huge gorilla pushes the door open and ambles out. He leans 
over and casually sniffs you. He then heads west out of the 
cave. 
$Do you follow the gorilla west? Goto 17a
$Do you head east? Goto 12
$Do you go through the south exit? Goto 16
---
15 $This chamber holds a large computer with a screen the 
size of a bed. A virtual face appears on the screen, 
resembling a young blond man. "Hi, my name is Max. Welcome 
to Omnicorp Biological Laboratories. You must be new - my 
sensors don't recognise you. My processors are busy 
recombining virtual DNA sequences so I'm afraid you can 
only ask one question." What questions do you ask the face
on the screen? 
$"How did I get here?" Goto 15a
$"How do I get out of here?" Goto 15b
$"What is going on in this facility?" Goto 15c
---
15a $"You walked into this room!" The face on the screen 
gives a weird electronic laugh. Max then adds a quizical 
face. "You don't remember getting to this facility? You 
tried to infiltrate the facility to find out what we at 
Omnicorp Biology Laboratories are up to. You were caught 
and deposited at the back of the caverns. Sorry, but our 
chat is over". The screen goes blanks and you leave. 
$You head back north. Goto 12 
---
15b $ "To get out of here is not easy. All humans are currently 
trapped here while Sheelob is out of her containment cell. 
Have you met Sheelob? Big, scary, multiple legs? Bit of a 
problem. I compute you cannot defeat her by yourself. The 
only thing that can stop Sheelob is Big Monk. He's about 12 
foot tall, hairy and got something of an attitude. But he 
really doesn't like Sheelob." Max hesitates and says 
"Sorry, newer, high priority calculations have arrived in 
RAM. Gotta go." The screen goes blank and you decide to 
leave. 
$You head back north. Goto 12 
---
15c $"What's going on here? Serious biological research! Of
course, it's being conducted in a hidden cave system away 
from annoying prying eyes due to legal and ethical reasons, 
namely what we are doing here is illegal and unethical, but 
Dr Ungol has assured me that it's perfectly okay. Nice 
chatting to you, but I've got to get back to work." Max's 
face disappears as the screen goes blank. 
$You head back north. Goto 12 
---
16 $This room has a middle aged man, stern-looking with 
steel rimmed glasses, sat behind a desk. Before you can do
anything he pulls a gun on you. "Allow me to introduce myself
I am Dr Ungol, the chief scientist of this facility, which 
you sneaked into. I'm sorry my dear chap,
but we can't have intruders like you wandering around here
sticking their noses into my business." The room has no 
other exits. What do you do?
$Rush at the man and try to tackle him. Goto 16a
$Talk to the man. Goto 16b
$Try to escape the way you came Goto 16c
---
16a $You charge at Dr Ungol but he is too fast for you. 
Shots ring out in rapid succession and you are hit several
times. //-5
$Although wounded you manage to fling yourself out of the
door before Dr Ungol can reload and you head back north. Goto 14
